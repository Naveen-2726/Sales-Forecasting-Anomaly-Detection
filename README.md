🔷 Project Title

Sales Forecasting & Anomaly Detection (AI Project)

🔷 Project Description

This project focuses on transforming traditional reactive sales reporting into predictive and AI-driven analytics using Power BI. By leveraging built-in AI visuals such as Forecasting, Anomaly Detection, and Smart Narratives, the project enables early identification of sales trends, unusual patterns, potential risks, and growth opportunities to support better business decision-making.

🔷 Problem Statement

A retail organization generates large volumes of sales data, making manual analysis inefficient and error-prone. Management requires a predictive solution to forecast future sales, detect anomalies in sales behavior, and automatically generate insights to identify risks and opportunities at an early stage.

🔷 Objectives

Forecast future sales using AI-powered analytics

Detect unusual sales patterns (anomalies)

Identify seasonality and long-term trends

Generate automated insights using Smart Narratives

Support proactive and data-driven decision-making

🔷 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

AI Visuals

Forecast

Anomaly Detection

Smart Narrative

GitHub (Version Control & Project Hosting)

🔷 Dataset Description

Retail sales dataset

Key attributes include:

Order Date

Sales

Category

Region

Segment

The dataset is time-series in nature, making it suitable for forecasting and anomaly detection.

🔷 Methodology

Data cleaning and preprocessing in Power BI

Creation of key measures using DAX

Visualization of historical sales trends

Identification of seasonal patterns

Application of AI-based forecasting

Detection of anomalies with expected range comparison

Auto-generation of insights using Smart Narratives

🔷 Key Features Implemented

📈 Historical sales trend analysis

📊 Seasonality identification

🤖 AI-based sales forecasting

🚨 Anomaly detection with explanations

🧠 Smart Narrative for automatic insight generation

🔷 Insights & Observations

Sales exhibit clear seasonality, with strong growth in later periods

The AI forecast predicts continued upward sales trends

Detected anomalies highlight unusual sales spikes and drops, which may be due to promotions, discounts, or operational disruptions

🔷 Forecast Reliability

The forecast model is reliable as it:

Uses historical patterns and seasonality

Provides confidence intervals

Continuously adapts to new data trends

However, accuracy may be affected by unexpected external factors such as market changes or sudden demand shifts.

🔷 Business Recommendations

Optimize inventory planning based on forecasted demand

Investigate anomaly periods to understand root causes

Adjust marketing and pricing strategies proactively

Use AI insights to reduce risks and maximize revenue opportunities
